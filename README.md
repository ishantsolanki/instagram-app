## Instagram Style product Feed

A sample application built with nextJS React framework featuring PWA capabilities, infinite scroll and offline support. 

#### Features
 - Horizontal swipe to navigate feed of products
 - Filter capability that can be extended easily to inculde more filters given that there is API support.
 - Ability to add products to basket and get a view of the items in the basket and total amount to pay.
 - Infinite scrolling with 25 items per request.
 - Offline support
 - Analytics. Events logged for events like product view duration, filters applied and products bought.

 #### How do I run the App locally?
  1. Unzip the package
  2. Open terminal, `cd` into the package root.
  3. run `yarn && yarn build && yarn start` (Assuming you have yarn package manager installed)
  4. Navigate the url in the browser `localhost:3000`

  #### Assumptions
   - Instagram typically has a combination of vertical scroll feeds with horizontal scroll for particular feed. As the video in the test statement only shows horizontal scroll, I assume thats what is required. However, I believe the code can be extended to have a vertical scroll of more products with their own horizontal scroll of product range.
   - Its assumed, the user always has enough money in the account.

   #### Feedback on the Test
    Thank you for the opportunity to present this test. I certainly did enjoy every bit of it. There were a few new things I learned along the way and I hope I did justice to the brief. If I would have more time, I could have incorporated typescript and also unit tests. I believe they are fundamental to every project although can slow down the rapid development. However, it wasnt an ask, So I decided not to, for the sake of saving time which I spent quality weekend time with family.(work-test/life balance? ðŸ˜„)

    As a suggestion, I would ask for code submission by an invite to a private repo. This way you can also see how the code progressed over each commit and how descriptive each commits were. The frequency of commits and commit messages speak a lot about how a developer approaches code.
